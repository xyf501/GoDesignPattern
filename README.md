# GoDesignPattern
## Gang Of Four design pattern
## Go Concurrency
the languages we are using are still the ones created when we had single core CPUs, such as Java or C++. They lack a proper concurrency support by design.
### Concurrency VS. Parallelism
- Concurrency is about dealing with many things at once
- Parallelism is about doing many things at the same time
